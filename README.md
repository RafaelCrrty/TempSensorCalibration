A program designed for the calibration of temperature sensors has been developed, allowing the inclusion of specific intervals and ranges. The creation of this application implements Arduino to obtain data from temperature sensors. By using the constants 'a' and 'b', adjusted to the corresponding curve once the temperatures of the indicated intervals and ranges have been averaged, a more precise approximation of the acquired temperature is achieved, thus improving the precision of the system.
